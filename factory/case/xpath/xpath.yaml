case:
  name: XPath Web Element Locator

  purpose:
    This case ensures a developer is able to locate a web element using XPath Locator.
    XPath is designed to allow the navigation of XML documents with the purpose of 
    selecting individual elements, attributes,or some other part of an XML document for 
    specific processing. XPath produces reliable locators but in performance wise it is
    slower (especially in IE older versions) compared to CSS Selector.
