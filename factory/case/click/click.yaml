case:
  name: Click Action

  purpose:
   This test case ensures a developer is able to perform Clicks at the current mouse location.
   The click event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element,
   and the mouse button is pressed and released. The click command emulates a click
   operation for a link, button, checkbox or radio button. It takes a locator
   (an identifier for which HTML element the command refers to) as an argument.
